# Papa Birthday Website 🎉

This is a simple birthday website (HTML/CSS/JS) with:
- Photo(s)
- A background hero image
- A music player (`assets/musicbday.mp3`)
- Confetti effect
- A wish card + checklist saved in the browser (localStorage)

## Run locally
Just open `index.html` in your browser.

## Publish on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new GitHub repo (example: `papa-bday`).
2. Upload all files in this folder to the repo (keep the same structure).
3. On GitHub: **Settings → Pages**
4. Under **Build and deployment**, choose:
   - **Source:** Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch:** `main` (or `master`) and `/ (root)`
5. Save — your site will appear at the GitHub Pages URL.

Tip: If you want a custom domain later, add it in Settings → Pages.
